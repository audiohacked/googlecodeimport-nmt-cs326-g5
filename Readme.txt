You will need wxWidgets and CMake installed!

To build on Linux and Mac OS X:
	mkdir build-os
	cd build-os
	cmake ..
	make

Have Fun with this!

P.S. Since I've been writing/programming on linux/mac, I don't know how to 
	work this on windows and/or VC++.


WINXP/VISTA: I've edited this version to work with VC++ Express 2008, 
wxWidgets, and CMake; all for windows, downside is you have to build
the libraries for wxWidgets with VC++, but just download the windows version
of the dependencies from each website. A google search will help with getting 
what you need.
