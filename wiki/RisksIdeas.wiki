#summary Risk Management Ideas for Proposal

== Ideas ==
Platform-Dependent Code: 
-Risk Level: critical- 
-Risk Categories: PR & TE-
Talked about this one a little in the proposal already, but to avoid this risk, we're obviously going to be using cross-platform libraries.  To monitor this risk, we're going to use peer review of coding.  To manage this risk if does become an issue, we'll come together to try and find a cross platform solution for the task or discuss how to minimize the amount of platform-specific code we have to write.
