Actors: Basic User, Centralized Content Server, Database
Pre-condition: User has rights over the file for deletion or is a content distributor.

  # User selects a file for deletion.
  # Client sends delete request to content server.
  # Content server removes file and any related information, opens a connection to the database and sends a corresponding delete (this may actually be an archival rather than a physical deletion) query for the file's database entries.
  # Database completes query, server reports success to client.
  # Client reports success to user.
