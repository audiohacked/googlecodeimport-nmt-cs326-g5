#summary We can brainstorm and detail use cases here.

= List of Actors =
List probable actors below:
  * Basic User (human)
  * Content Distributor/Server Admin (human, inherits from user)
  * Database
  * Centralized Content Server
  * Tracker (for torrents)

= Use Case Diagram =

When we're satisfied with the use cases below we can convert them into a big use case diagram here.

I really tried to minimize criss-crossing the lines and came up with this.  I color coded the <<include>>, <<extends>, and inheritance relationships.

= Use Case Details =
Below is a table containing every use case along with auxiliary information.

|| _Use Case_ || _Actor(s)_ || _Entry Condition_ || _Exit Condition_  || _Extends/Includes/Inherits_ ||
|| DownloadFile || Basic User || User initiates a file download from the content server (can be an actual file or a torrent file). || User finishes file download or file download error. || *Includes* ReportTransferProgress, ReportFileDownload ||

|| DownloadTorrentFile || Basic User, Tracker || User initiates a file download via BitTorrent. || User completes download and shares file to a specified ratio, or user opts to stop sharing or downloading the file prematurely. || *Inherits* DownloadFile ||
|| ReportFileDownload || Database || A file transfer to the client completes. || File download statistics are reported and stored in the database. || N/A ||
|| ReportFileUpload || Database || File finishes uploading to the Centralized Content Server. || The database has allocated the proper space and structure to accommodate statistics for the sponsored file. || N/A ||
|| UploadFile || Basic User, Centralized Content Server  || User selects a file which will become sponsored content. || File is uploaded to centralized content server. || *Includes* ReportFileUpload, ReportTransferProgress, DesignateFileSponsoredStatus ||
