=Project Proposal & Plan=

==Introduction==
Describe in one or two paragraph the motivation for the project.
The purpose of this software project is to develop a client application which facilitates file distribution.  The project aims to utilize multiple file transfer protocols and be available on many operating systems.  The software's primary motivation is the desire to provide a universal, intuitive, and streamlined method for retrieving files in an efficient manner.

===Project Overview and Statement of Proposal===
Provide an overview of the project and then make a statement of proposal.
*Statement of Proposal*: _We propose to …_
We propose to..make what I described above?

===Project Scope and Objectives===
Define the scope of the project and the objectives to be satisfied by this project.

===Discussion of Risks to Be Managed===
Summarize the contents of the risk table. Indicate why project includes or does not include certain risks. Explain the severity and probability of the risks.

===Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management Plan===
This section describes what is to be done to avoid each risk (Section 2.3.1), how the team will monitor its activities to detect when a risk becomes a problem (Section 2.3.2), and what will be done for each risk if it becomes a problem (Section 2.3.3).

====Risk Mitigation====
Explain how each risk will be avoided. (Keep in mind that some activities may help to mitigate more than one risk while some risks may require multiple mitigation activities.)

====Risk Monitoring====
Explain how the team will monitor each risk to detect if the risk is becoming a problem. (Keep in mind that some activities may help to monitor more than one risk while some risks may require multiple monitors.)

====Risk Management (Contingency Plans)====
Explain what will be done for each risk if the risk becomes a problem. (Keep in mind that the same contingency plan may apply to more than one risk.)

==Schedule==
