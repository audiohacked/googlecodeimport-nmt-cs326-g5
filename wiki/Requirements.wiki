=Digital Content Distribution and Publishing System=
=Team #5=
==Requirements Specification==

===Project Overview===
The program will provide a cross-platform content distribution and publishing service. It will use a client-server model where the server will use and provide service through standard programs/services like Apache and MySQL. The customer can choose to use the server to distribute published files or allow users to upload their own content that can be sponsored/featured on the server.

===Scope and Objectives===
The scope of the project is to build a base platform for customers to create a digital community and publishing system while also supporting at least Linux, Windows, and Mac user alike. The main function of the system is to provide an end-user a way to obtain digital content like movies, music, and other entertainment. The system has to be fast, native-looking, and easily changeable/upgradeable. To insure the user's client is up to date, it will include an self updater. To facilitate downloading, the client will use bittorrent and http/ftp. Also the client can be configured to include Community Portal and /or a web browser.

===Supplementary Requirements===
Describe the non-functional requirements (grouped according to type â€“ i.e., interface, physical, design, and implementation) identified for this project.
*FURPS Non-functional Requirements (Quality)*

_Usability_
  * Users familiar with other content distribution platforms and file transfer clients should feel at ease with this system.
  * User interface should always strive for simplicity and intuitiveness.
  * User interface should follow a tabbed system to divide functionality and reduce complexity.

_Reliability_
  * The entire system must be robust enough to handle common networking issues like dropped connections, missing files, and transfer errors.
  * User authentication system should use common security practices.

_Performance_
  * File transfers should initiate within two seconds of a client's request.
  * Content server should responsibly manage available bandwidth to achieve optimal browsing and transfer speeds.

_Supportability_
  * Content server's closed website system should be mostly dynamic, adapting to file additions/removals as well as changes in existing files' properties.

*FURPS+ Additional Non-functional Requirements (Constraints)*

_Implementation_
  * The client will be implemented in C++, utilizing the gtkWidgets library for cross-platform code.

*Actor Descriptions and Use-Cases by Actor*

_Basic User_ - the target audience for downloads, uses the client software.

_Content Distributor/Server Admin_ - the manager of the Centralized Content Server, inherits functionality from Basic User.

_Database_ - provides storage and retrieval for information on downloads. This includes file location, file attributes, statistics including number of downloads, and other vital information.

_Centralized Content Server_ - communicates with the client software and the database.

_Boundary_
    * GUI - Provides the user interface, the main interaction between the user and the program. Used to initiate downloads, uploads, browse the content server, and edit user preferences.  Calls the preferenceDialogue when preferences are changed and communicates with the ContentManager class to initiate downloads/uploads.
    * preferenceDialogue - allows the user to edit their preferences relating to the operation of the program, including options related to torrenting and user interface options.

_Control_
    * ContentManager - is the controller that provides the client with all information pertaining to downloads available, browsing the downloads available, user authentication, and uploading of files. Communicates directly with the database server through the DBManager class.
    * TransferManager - provides the interface that the other transfer managers implement
    * TorrentTransferManager - implements methods included in TransferManager and methods specific to torrent downloads, such as connectToTracker()
    * HTTPTransferManager - implements methods included in TransferManager and methods specific to HTTP transfers

_Entity_
    * DBManager - provides an interface to the ContentManager to update and query the database, which provides lists and attributes of downloads and the files that make up the downloads.
    * Download - provides an interface that specific downloads implement that includes methods and attributes that are common to all downloads.
    * TorrentDownload - implements the Download interface and includes methods and attributes that are unique to torrent downloading, such as peerLocations and trackerLocations. Includes one or more file objects.
    * HTTPDownload - implements the Download interface and includes methods and attributes that are unique to HTTP downloads, such as getFileName. Includes one file.
    * file - includes attributes of a file and a method for retrieving those attributes.
